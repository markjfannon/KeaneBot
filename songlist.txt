Oh simple thing, where have you gone? - somewhere only we know
Aching, waiting for life to start - bend and break
I don't know your thoughts these days - we might as well be strangers
Trying to make a move just to stay in the game - everybodys changing
And it's a lonely end that you will come to - your eyes open
Lonely people tumble upwards - she has no time
While I've been stuck here, dithering around - can't stop now
Where only some dumb idiot would let you go - sunshine
Tread it into the carpet or hide it under the stairs - this is the last time
I saw you were sick and tired of my wrong turns - on a day like today
An empty face and empty bones - untitled 1
And I've fallen by the wayside now - bedshaped
I need a place that's hidden in the deep - atlantic
Nothing left beside this old cathedral - is it any wonder
When you wanna die, when you hurt inside - nothing in my way
I can't turn it on, turn it off like you now - leaving so soon
Where do we go? I don't even know - a bad dream
I lay myself done to make it so - hamburg song
Don't care what she said. Only in your head - put it behind you
*strange piano noises* - the iron sea
I fall upon the earth, I call upon the air - crystal ball
God, I wish you could see me now - try again
Who says a river can't leave its waters? - broken toy
You've wandered so far from the person you are - the frog prince
The map of my world gets smaller as I sit here - spiralling
We cling to a skidding car, cling to a corner - the lovers are losing
Holding my photograph up to the window - better than this
Give me your worst, I won't even blink - you haven't told me anything
There is no golden gate, there's no heaven waiting for you - perfect symmetry
All spinning outwards from your sun, passing your reflection on - you don't see me
Was it just a dream, just a dream? cause it was real to me - again and again
Going to shut out the noise with a rock'n'roll song - playing along
I wonder what I'd do if I could wake up every morning with a clean slate - pretend that you're alone
The sky will be my shroud, a cenotaph of clout - black burning heart
These are the things that I want to remember, I want to remember you by - love is the end
And when you're running out of time, that's when you hitch your star to mine - my shadow
